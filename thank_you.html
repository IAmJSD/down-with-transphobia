                Thank you for helping to send your opinion to the government about this. It is always possible this won't make a difference, but at least we all tried our hardest to make a difference.

                If you want to help spread the message more to people who may not be comfortable using emails, you can share this website with #DownWithTransphobia in the hope that more people will see it and send a message to the government. Even if you don't want to join a hashtag though, just spread the word about this act! This is a despicable act by the government and it needs to be called out by as many people as possible.
